# Fabricio: infrastructures

This example shows how to use roles within different infrastructures. There are one role and one infrastructure defined in [fabfile.py](fabfile.py). But you can define as many additional roles and infrastructures as you need.

## Requirements
* Fabricio 0.4.7 or greater
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
* One from the [list of Vagrant supported providers](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/) (this example was tested with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/))

## Files
* __fabfile.py__, Fabricio configuration
* __README.md__, this file
* __Vagrantfile__, Vagrant config

## Virtual Machine creation

Run `vagrant up` and wait until VM will be created.

## List of available commands

    fab --list

## Deploy

To deploy to a particular infrastructure you need to provide its name before any other command:

    fab vagrant app
    
This command will start deploy to the `vagrant` infrastructure.

Also you can use `vagrant.confirm` command to skip confirmation dialog and start tasks execution immediately.

If no infrastructure selected then Fabricio will use default roles definition (in that case you should manually set default roles in your `fabfile.py`, see [Fabric documentation](http://docs.fabfile.org/)). Also if there is no hosts found for a role then any task which needs to be executed on a remote host will be skipped.

## Deploy to localhost

Same configuration can be deployed to localhost:

    fab localhost app

even without SSH daemon enabled:

    fab localhost:force_local=yes app
    
The latter is possible due to special "force_local" parameter passed to `localhost` infrastructure definition. See [fabfile.py](fabfile.py) for details.

## Parallel execution

Any Fabricio command can be executed in parallel mode. This mode provides advantages when you have more then one host to deploy to. Use `--parallel` option if you want to run command on all hosts simultaneously:

    fab --parallel vagrant app
